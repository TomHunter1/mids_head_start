#Welcome, fellow MIDS students!#

As you know, MIDS students enter the program with widely varied backgrounds. This repo is intended to provide learning resources for classes where you might be less familiar with the subject matter.

This repo is not intended to teach you the actual MIDS materials, but rather to help you build the foundational knowledge you will need to focus properly on the actual coursework.

#How to Contribute#

We welcome all pull requests from current/previous MIDS students who know of good learning resources that would be helpful to those in the program!
